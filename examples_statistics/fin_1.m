%% Periodic  interest rate
%{ 
Lenders typically quote interest rates on an annual basis, but the interest compounds more frequently than annually in most cases.
Interest on mortgages usually compounds monthly. An investment's periodic rate is 1% if it has an effective annual return of 12% and it
compounds every month.
