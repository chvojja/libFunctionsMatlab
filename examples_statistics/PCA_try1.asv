[coeff,score,latent] = pca(ingredients);

score*coeff' % these are original x with means subtracted
ingred_means = mean(ingredients);
ingredients - ingred_means  % (X-mean(x))= score*coeff' e.g. to transform x to the PCA's new base, we need to multiply: (X-mean(x))*inv(coeff')

coeffTInv = inv(coeff'); % these are the weig
